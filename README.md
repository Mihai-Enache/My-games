# My-games
  I created 3 games in this repository.
  I used OpenGL and Visual Studio to create these game. To start the first game, from Visual Studio, modify in the file Main.cpp, 
World *world = new Tema1(), then run. The first game is the same as Flappy Bird. In this game, player control a bird that needs to avoid 
obstacles. The bird can go up using SPACE and when it hits the ground or an obstacle the game ends. To start again after you died press S.
The number of points you make is equal to the number of obstacles that you pass.
  The second game is an endless runner with a plane. To start this game, from Visual Studio, modify in the file Main.cpp, 
World *world = new Tema2(), then run. In this game you control a plane that has 3 lives and a tank full of combustible. The game ends after
you lost all the lives or you remain without combustible. The tank lose the combustible in time. To refill it you need to catch the green 
objects that appear in the game. If you hit a red object you lose a life. The plane start to go faster with time. In this game you can
change persperctive from third person to first person using C key and to restart use SPACE or ENTER. You control the plane using the mouse 
cursor.
  The third game is more like an exercise of mine to create a terrain using height maps. After that i just create a character that shoots 
balls in the space. If you want to see it,  from Visual Studio, modify in the file Main.cpp, World *world = new Tema3(), then run.
